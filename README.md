 Sales-Forecasting
Built a sales forecasting model using XGBoost to predict future demand and integrated it with inventory management to optimise stock levels
Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict future sales based on historical sales data.  
By identifying **trends, seasonality, and patterns**, it helps businesses make **data-driven decisions** to optimize inventory, production, and marketing strategies.
