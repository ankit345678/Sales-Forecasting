📌 Overview
This project applies Machine Learning to predict future sales based on historical sales data.  
By identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns, it helps businesses make **data-driven decisions** to optimize inventory, production, and marketing strategies.

🎯 Objectives
- Build a predictive model capable of forecasting sales with high accuracy.
- Enable better business planning through data analysis.
- Provide visual insights comparing historical and predicted data.

✨ Features
- 📊 Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values & outliers.
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Graphical trends & correlation analysis.
- 🤖 Model Implementation – Uses XGBoost for robust predictions.
- 📈 Visualization– Plots actual vs predicted sales for clarity.
- 🌐 Scalable Design – Can be adapted for multiple products or regions.
